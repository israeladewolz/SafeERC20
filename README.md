Block Explorer Link: [Moonbag Contract on Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0xa7F4195F10F1a62B102bD683eAB131d657A6c6e4#code)

Function Code: function forceApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
    bytes memory approvalCall = abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value);

    if (!_callOptionalReturnBool(token, approvalCall)) {
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, 0));
        _callOptionalReturn(token, approvalCall);
    }

## Explanation

Purpose: The `forceApprove` function is intended to set some allowance of an ERC20 token for the use of a spender. The first attempt at approval, in the case of failure, resets the allowance to zero before setting it.

Detailed Usage:
- **Encoding:** The function uses `abi.encodeWithSelector` to encode the `approve` function selector along with the spender's address and the value to be approved. This creates the call data necessary for interacting with the ERC20 token contract.
- **Low-Level Call:** The `_callOptionalReturnBool` function uses a low-level `call` to execute the encoded call for approval on the token contract. What it does is to bypass the high-level checks in Solidity, thus handling the success or failure of the call manually.

The low-level `call` exists for backwards compatibility with ERC20 tokens which due to lack of adherence to the standard couldn't strongly follow it, allowing a more robust and safe way of setting allowances.

Impact: The `forceApprove` function improves the SafeERC20 library with a reliable way to set token allowances, which includes all the non-compliant ERC20. This functionality is critical to DeFi protocols that interact with a wide array of tokens, ensuring that this protocol runs smoothly and predictably.
