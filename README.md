## Function Code
solidity
function forceApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
    bytes memory approvalCall = abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value);

    if (!_callOptionalReturnBool(token, approvalCall)) {
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, 0));
        _callOptionalReturn(token, approvalCall);
    }
}
# Explanation

## Purpose
The `forceApprove` function aims to set an ERC20 token's allowance for a spender. If the initial approval attempt fails, it first resets the allowance to zero before setting it to the desired value.

## Detailed Usage
- **Encoding:** The function uses `abi.encodeWithSelector` to encode the `approve` function selector along with the spender's address and the value to be approved. This creates the call data necessary for interacting with the ERC20 token contract.
- **Low-Level Call:** The `_callOptionalReturnBool` function uses a low-level `call` to execute the encoded approval call on the token contract. This bypasses Solidity's high-level checks and manually handles the success or failure of the call.

The low-level `call` is used to ensure compatibility with ERC20 tokens that might not strictly adhere to the standard, providing a more robust and fail-safe approach to setting allowances.

## Impact
The `forceApprove` function enhances the SafeERC20 library by providing a reliable method for setting token allowances, even for non-compliant ERC20 tokens. This functionality is crucial for DeFi protocols that interact with a variety of tokens, ensuring smooth and predictable operations within the protocol.
